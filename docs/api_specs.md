# API Specifications

## Scope

Despite the filename, the current public interface is a local CLI contract only.

MacroVeritas v0.1 does not expose a web API.

- No FastAPI service
- No REST or HTTP endpoints
- No SQL-backed service layer

The current CLI can be reached through the installed console script or via
`python -m macro_veritas` from the repository checkout.

`docs/cli_command_contracts.md` is the source of truth for the reserved
command-family contracts and the current public-vs-internal split.

## Stable Public CLI Commands

The following commands are the current stable public CLI surface.

### `macro_veritas status`

- Purpose: report the current scaffold stage, project identity, config path,
  data root, and layout-path presence.
- Expected effect: reads the resolved project configuration and prints a
  human-readable status summary to standard output.
- What it should not do: create directories, write registry objects, run
  scientific logic, or mutate configuration.

### `macro_veritas show-config`

- Purpose: show the resolved project configuration and derived layout paths.
- Expected effect: reads the project configuration and prints a JSON display
  view to standard output.
- What it should not do: change configuration, inspect scientific content,
  contact external services, or create filesystem artifacts.

### `macro_veritas init-layout`

- Purpose: initialize the placeholder filesystem layout under the configured
  data root.
- Expected effect: creates only missing top-level scaffold directories; with
  `--dry-run`, reports planned creations without writing.
- What it should not do: delete or overwrite existing content, populate
  registry cards, infer scientific metadata, or run analysis logic.

### `macro_veritas ingest study`

- Purpose: create one canonical `StudyCard` from explicit CLI fields.
- Expected effect: converts explicit CLI flags into normalized StudyCard ingest
  input, prepares one `StudyCardPayload`, calls StudyCard create planning,
  calls StudyCard create execution, and writes one canonical YAML file through
  the registry gateway.
- What it should not do: update an existing `StudyCard`, ingest `DatasetCard`
  or `ClaimCard`, infer scientific content, or bypass the gateway.
- Source of truth:
  [`docs/public_ingest_studycard_cli.md`](public_ingest_studycard_cli.md)

### `macro_veritas ingest dataset`

- Purpose: create one canonical `DatasetCard` from explicit CLI fields.
- Expected effect: converts explicit CLI flags into normalized DatasetCard
  ingest input, prepares one `DatasetCardPayload`, calls DatasetCard create
  planning, calls DatasetCard create execution, and writes one canonical YAML
  file through the registry gateway.
- What it should not do: update an existing `DatasetCard`, ingest `ClaimCard`,
  infer scientific content, or bypass the gateway.
- Source of truth:
  [`docs/public_ingest_datasetcard_cli.md`](public_ingest_datasetcard_cli.md)

## Reserved Internal Command Families

The following names remain reserved for broader future command-family work.

- `ingest` is public only for create-only `StudyCard` and `DatasetCard` paths.
- `ClaimCard` ingest remains internal/non-public.
- All other command families remain internal or deferred.

Their internal command-family contract is frozen in
[`docs/cli_command_contracts.md`](cli_command_contracts.md).

| CLI Group | Intended Purpose | Current Status | Internal Skeleton Module | Governance Domain Alignment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ingest` | Add initial study, dataset, or claim records into the planned registry. | Public for create-only `StudyCard` at `ingest study` and create-only `DatasetCard` at `ingest dataset`; ClaimCard ingest remains non-public. | `macro_veritas.commands.ingest` | Registry Department / 户部 |
| `bind` | Associate registry records with concrete raw, processed, or run-facing artifact locations. | Reserved internal skeleton only; not public CLI. | `macro_veritas.commands.bind` | Registry Department / 户部 |
| `extract` | Capture structured claim or metadata fragments from curated sources into project records. | Reserved internal skeleton only; not public CLI. | `macro_veritas.commands.extract` | Registry Department / 户部 |
| `audit` | Record routine review outcomes such as `pass`, `return`, or `escalate`. | Reserved internal skeleton only; not public CLI. | `macro_veritas.commands.audit` | Review Department / 刑部 |
| `review` | Hold the future escalated review / prosecution lane after a routine audit escalation. | Reserved internal skeleton only; not public CLI. | `macro_veritas.commands.review` | Prosecution / 检察院 |
| `run` | Manage declared run or bundle boundaries around future reanalysis work. | Reserved internal skeleton only; not public CLI. | `macro_veritas.commands.run` | Operations Department / 兵部 |
| `grade` | Assemble a lightweight evidence judgment view for a claim. | Reserved internal skeleton only; not public CLI. | `macro_veritas.commands.grade` | Review-adjacent; provisionally aligned to Review Department / 刑部 |
